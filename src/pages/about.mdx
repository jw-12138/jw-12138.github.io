I was born in a small town in [YangZhou](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%89%AC%E5%B7%9E%E5%B8%82) China in 1997. I am a Front-end Developer and a Music Producer. Although I started these two hobbies at the same time, my focus has shifted, and I now consider myself more of a Front-end Developer. While I have stopped making music for the past 2 years, you can still find my work on [QQ Music](https://y.qq.com) and [NetEase Music](https://music.163.com) under the name `Jacky.Q`. Despite that, my passion for music remains, and I may return to it someday.

I never went to college or high school because, simply put, I suck at studying. However, I later realized that my struggle wasn't with learning in general, but rather with subjects I didn't find interesting. It wasn't until I was 17 that I discovered my passion for coding and music-making, and from then on, my perspective changed. Most of the time, I would just watch YouTube for coding and music-making tutorials. As a non-English speaker, I've become quite adept at learning from these resources.

Back to the blog, this thing for me isn't fueled by grand ambition, but rather, a much simpler reason, _it looks god-damn cool_, and creating something with your knowledge and seeing it work just as you imagined is super satisfying. I don't post a lot, but I do enjoy writing, it's a process that uncovers hidden knowledge gaps and feels like teaching oneself with added details.
