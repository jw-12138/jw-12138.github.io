  I was born in a small town in YangZhou China in 1997. I am a Front-end Developer and a Music Producer. Although I started these two hobbies at the same time, my focus has shifted, and I now consider myself more of a Front-end Developer. While I have stopped making music for the past 2 years, you can still find my work on QQ Music and NetEase Music under the name `Jacky.Q`. Despite that, my passion for music remains, and I may return to it someday.

  I skipped formal education because traditional studying wasn't my forte. Later, I realized I only struggled with subjects that didn't captivate me. At 17, discovering coding and music production changed everything‚ÄîI found learning could be exciting. I taught myself through YouTube tutorials, becoming surprisingly proficient despite the language barrier. As for this blog, I maintain it simply because creating something functional with your own skills is deeply satisfying. While I don't post frequently, writing helps me identify knowledge gaps and solidify my understanding, much like teaching myself.
