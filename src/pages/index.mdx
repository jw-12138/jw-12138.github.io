  I'm from a small town in Yangzhou, China, born in 1997. These days I spend most of my time as a full-stack developer, though I used to make music too. You can still find some of my old tracks on QQ Music and NetEase Music under "Jacky.Q", haven't touched that in a few years, but who knows, maybe I'll get back to it.

  School and I didn't really click, so I dropped out pretty early. Turns out I just needed to find stuff that actually interested me. When I discovered coding and music production at 17, everything changed. Spent countless hours watching YouTube tutorials, figuring things out despite my English being pretty rough back then. This blog exists because I like building things that work, and writing helps me think through problems. Don't post much, but when I do, it's usually because I'm trying to wrap my head around something new.
