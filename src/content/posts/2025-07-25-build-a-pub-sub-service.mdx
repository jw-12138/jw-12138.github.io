title: Build an Edge-friendly Self-hosted Pub/Sub service

Our bills on Cloudflare just exploded last month, up by around 2500%. I mean, our product kinda went viral while launching the new Agent Neo, but the bill shouldn't be like this.

The culprit? **Durable Objects.**

Yes, we were using Cloudflare Durable Objects as a pub/sub backend, which should be a lightweight real-time messaging layer to make our agent Neo work.

Well, it worked at first... until it didn’t.

Turns out that Durable Objects are quite literally the worst possible architecture for a high-frequency, high concurrency pub/sub system.

## The Origin

> Create AI agents, collaborative applications, real-time interactions like chat, and more without needing to coordinate state, have separate storage, or manage infrastructure.
>
> -- Cloudflare Durable Objects

Before I joined Flowith, I built a small end-to-end encrypted 1-on-1 chat app, it was fully serverless, and yes, it used Durable Objects for real-time messaging. It was simple, clean, elegant, and most importantly, cheap, but was never battle-tested.

When the plan for Agent Neo came together, our AI agent with real-time interactions, I naturally thought:

> “Why not reuse that little pub/sub module I made?”

Famous last words.

## The Fix

Before jumping straight into rebuilding everything from scratch, we tried to find a managed solution that could just work. We looked into popular real-time platforms like Ably and Pusher, which are services designed for exactly this kind of use case, but they all had limitations.

Ably's maximum message size is 256KB, this might be far enough for chatting apps, but our agent? Sometimes it pushed multi-megabyte messages, especially when the agent starts to make websites, things could blow up quickly.

Pusher was even more constrained, much lower message size limit and no pay-as-you-go plan, that’s a non-starter for an infra component that needs to handle bursty, unpredictable traffic.

And then we found Upstash Redis, actually we were already spending hundreds of dollars per month on Upstash, and we never noticed it had a built-in pub/sub.

> 🤦 The thing we need was sitting in our stack the whole time.

For compatibility concerns, we made a proxy service which runs on a server, and exposed 2 RESTful APIs for simple message publications/subscriptions.

And here is the core of the setup:

```js
await pubRedis.publish(channel, JSON.stringify(message))
```

On the receiving end:

```js
await subRedis.subscribe(requestChannel)
```

Servers post messages via `POST /channel/:channel/messages` (Ably style), and clients subscribe via `GET /sub?channel=... `, and messages are streamed to clients using Server-Sent Events which can be easily proxied by any edge computing platforms (Vercel Edge Functions, Cloudflare Workers).

This service runs on a lightweight VPS ($40/month), with minimal CPU and memory usage. It’s fully stateless and ready for horizontal scaling.

## The Result

We just reduced the cost of our pub/sub module from $5000/month to $100/month and lower.
