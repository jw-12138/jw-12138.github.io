About a month ago, I ended a six-year relationship with the girl I once promised to spend the rest of my life with ðŸ¤¡.

From her perspective: "I can't stand his parents. They're aggressively trying to take control of our lives and I hate that feeling. I'm okay with him, but I can't handle his family dynamic. I refuse to pretend I'm okay with them just to keep the peace. I won't fake it."

Well, I know my parents can sometimes be controlling, but that depends on the things I do. They nag because I play too late and get home late, I spend too much money on useless things, I don't have any savings to prevent future accidents, I get too lazy to clean my room...

They did nothing wrong. All the nagging is just parents caring about their own kid, so they want to do the same for their son's future wife. I don't find it "incorrect" or "evil." Instead, I started to understand them. Other than that, they wouldn't interfere with any other choices I made, even though they didn't like the girl from the start, they let me be with her.

The reason we break up is simple: I don't love her, at least not that much.

Oh and, I never liked her gay(male) friends around her, calling each other "sister"?

Fuck it, I need lesbian friends calling each other "bro"!
